 GBV Reporting & Support Platform (Kenya)

A mobile-first platform with USSD integration to help minors in Kenya report and manage gender-based violence (GBV) cases—such as rape, early marriages, and FGM—especially in areas with limited internet access.

## 🚨 Problem

In Kenya, many minors under 18 face gender-based violence (GBV), including rape, early marriages, and female genital mutilation (FGM). Despite efforts by the government to create frameworks to combat GBV, existing systems for reporting and managing these cases are:

- Outdated and slow
- Inaccessible in rural areas due to lack of internet connectivity
- Poorly coordinated among hospitals, police, and support organizations

This leads to underreporting, delays in help, and inadequate protection for victims.

## 🌍 Solution

A simple, secure, and USSD-integrated mobile application that:

- Works in both *English* and *Kiswahili*
- Allows *quick and anonymous reporting* of GBV cases
- Functions *without internet*, especially in rural communities
- Connects survivors with *medical, legal, and psychosocial support*
- Helps authorities and NGOs *manage data efficiently*
